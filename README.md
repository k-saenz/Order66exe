<h3>This site is being developed using ASP.NET Core 5.0</h3>
<p>
  If you have any experience with Website development (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) or Microsoft technologies (ASP.NET, C#, etc), or if you would like learn any of these, 
  you are more than welcome to clone this repo and mess around with the code.
  After all, I created this project to practice coding and deploying web applications.
