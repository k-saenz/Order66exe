<h1>Welcome to the Order66.exe Website repo</h1>
<h3>This site is being developed using ASP.NET Core</h3>
<p>
  If you have any experience with Website development (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.), MVC (Razor Pages, ASP.NET), or APIs, or if you would like learn any of these, 
  you are more than welcome to clone this repo and mess around with the code.
  After all, I created this project to practice coding and deploying web applications.
