<h1>Welcome to the Order66.exe Website repo</h1>
<br>
<h3>This site is being developed using ASP.NET Core, with a .NET 5.0 framework</h3>
<p>
  If you have any experience with Website designing (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) or Microsoft technologies (ASP.NET, C#, etc), or if you would like learn any of these, 
  you are more than welcome to clone this repo and mess around with the code.
  After all, I created this project to practice coding and deploying web applications.
